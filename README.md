Hi, I am Pavla

I am currently on maternity leave and because i needed some brain fuel and I'm also an apple fan, I began self-studying programming in Swift. Thanks to junior.guru, I became part of a great IT community where people helped me find the right direction and kept me motivated. At the same time I have the honor of being a moderator on the junior.guru discord.

I began my learning journey around September 2022 and I strive to allocate time to it almost every day, which is not so difficult, because I genuinely enjoy programming.
