# Mobile Apps for Fun 

## About me
I am an Apple enthusiast, and during my parental leave, I began self-studying programming in Swift. I enjoy working on UI/UX design and love using SwiftUI, though I also give UIKit a chance. Recently, I started learning React Native to expand my skills. My main focus remains on mobile app development.

- **September 2022:** started learning Swift

## My Projects
- [PodStack](https://github.com/PavlaBerankova/PodStack/tree/develop/swift-data) - As a podcast enthusiast, I can create my own folders with podcasts and their episodes in this app, giving me a better overview of new episodes on specific topics. This allows me to easily choose a topic that interests me at the moment—whether it’s news, educational podcasts, English-language podcasts, or just entertainment and talk shows. The app is designed for browsing and organizing only; to play an episode, it opens in the Apple Podcasts app. I’m still working on the app.
- [CareerPathLog](https://github.com/PavlaBerankova/CareerPathLog) - mobile app, when user can records sent CV, job offer information, filter and sort by status
- [Kulturmapa](https://github.com/PavlaBerankova/kulturmapa/tree/develop/events) - project from [Futured DevAcademy (2023)](https://github.com/futuredapp/dev-academy-ios), mobile app shows cultural place and events in Brno. 
  - this app is also already on [AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/cz/app/kulturmapa/id6477453765?l=cs&platform=iphone).
