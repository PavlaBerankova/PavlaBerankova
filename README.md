# Programming for Fun 

## About me
üë©‚Äçüíª I started learning programming since 2022, during my parental leave, first with Swift.

üå± Along the way I‚Äôve explored some web basics (HTML, CSS, JS), React Native and lately Python and Kotlin.

‚ú® I enjoy UI/UX design, building mobile apps, and discovering how things work across platforms.

üì± My main focus is mobile development, but I like to try a bit of everything to keep learning and growing.

## My Projects
### Mobile Apps

- [Lid√© ≈†tatlu](https://github.com/PavlaBerankova/LideStatlu) - a very simple mobile application displaying data on the structure of Brno's population
- [CareerPathLog](https://github.com/PavlaBerankova/CareerPathLog) - mobile app, when user can records applied CV, job offer information, filter and sort by status
- [Kulturmapa](https://github.com/PavlaBerankova/kulturmapa/tree/develop/events) - project from [Futured DevAcademy (2023)](https://github.com/futuredapp/dev-academy-ios), mobile app shows cultural place and events in Brno. 
  - this app is also already on [AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/cz/app/kulturmapa/id6477453765?l=cs&platform=iphone).
 
- [Guess The Number](https://github.com/PavlaBerankova/GuessNumber) - MY VERY FIRST MOBILE APP, NOTHING SPECIAL, BUT LOTS OF FUN
 
### Frontend
- [Solution from Frontendmentor](https://github.com/PavlaBerankova/frontend-mentor?tab=readme-ov-file) - since I enjoy frontend and UI, I tried out a few frontend mentor challenges.

- [PodStack](https://github.com/PavlaBerankova/PodStack/tree/develop/swift-data) - As a podcast enthusiast, I can create my own folders with podcasts and their episodes in this app, giving me a better overview of new episodes on specific topics. This allows me to easily choose a topic that interests me at the moment‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs news, educational podcasts, English-language podcasts, or just entertainment and talk shows. The app is designed for browsing and organizing only; to play an episode, it opens in the Apple Podcasts app. I‚Äôm still working on the app.
