I am currently on maternity leave and because i needed some brain fuel, I began self-studying programming in Swift. Thanks to junior.guru, I became part of a great IT community where people helped me find the right direction and kept me motivated.

I began my learning journey around September 2022 and I strive to allocate time to it almost every day, which is not so difficult, because I genuinely enjoy programming.

I firmly believe in the motto "1% BETTER EVERY DAY" and my long-term aspiration is to work as an iOS developer.

During parental leave, I rearranged my priorities, so it is important for me to do work that I enjoy and there is still something to learn, which IT allows me to do.
