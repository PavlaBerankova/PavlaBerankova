## About me
I am an Apple enthusiast, and during my parental leave, I began self-studying programming in Swift. I enjoy working on UI/UX design, and I love using SwiftUI, though I am also giving UIKit a chance.

- I started learning `Swift` in September 2022.
- Since I enjoy the design aspect more, I began learning frontend development - `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript` at the end of 2024.

## My Projects
